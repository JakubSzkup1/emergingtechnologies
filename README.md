# Trigram Language Model Project - README

## Project Overview

This project implements a third-order letter approximation model(trigram model) of the English Language. I have used five public domain texts from Project Gutenberg. The tasks include text preprocessing, trigram model creation, text generation, model analysis and model export. There is four main tasks in this project,each building on the previous task.Python's standard library has been used for this project without any third-party libraries.

## Tasks Overview

### Task1: Third-order Letter Approximation model
For this task, I have used five English works from Project Gutenburg to create a trigram model. The text is cleaned up, making sure only uppercase letters, spaces and fullstops are kept. The model captures the occurence of each three-charcter sequence in the cleaned up text.

- **Function: 'preprocess_text(text)'**
- This function preprocesses the text by removing all the characters except for uppercase letters, spaces and full stops.

- **Function: 'create_trigram model(text)'**
- This function creates a dictionary where the keys are trigrams and values are the number of times they appear in the text.


### Task 2: Third-order Letter Approximation Text Generation




### Task 3: Analyze the Generated Text





### Task 4: Export the Trigram Model as JSON
